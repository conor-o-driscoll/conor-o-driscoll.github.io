date: 21-06-2024
excerpt: "I was invited onto a regional radio station _Kildare Today_ to discuss recent research which explored the cost-effectiveness associated travelling by different modes of transport when commuting in the Dublin Metropolitan Area. The context of the discussion centred around [this piece](https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2024/0617/1455070-dublin-travel-costs-commute-built-environment-time-density/), published previously by _RTE Brainstorm_. You can listen to this discussion [here](https://www.kfmradio.com/player/podcasts/episodes/friday-21st-june-2024-hour-2/). [The research paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2024.103870) associated with these discussions explores the cost-effectiveness associated travelling by different modes of transport when commuting in the Dublin Metropolitan Area. <br/><img src='/images/rte_2024.jpg'>"
