excerpt: "[This blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-relationship-between-socio-demographics-travel-commuter-journal/?published=t) describes the major findings from a recent research paper. In this paper, we use fine-grain spatial data and individual-level census data to analyse the interrelationships between socio-demographic characteristics, local built environments, and travel mode choices for commuters across the Republic of Ireland. This post describes the major findings of this work and situates the implications of these findings in the context of pressing policymaking issues in Ireland. <br/><img src='/images/cork_traffic.jpg'>"
