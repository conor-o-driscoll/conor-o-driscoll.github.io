title: "Retail Centres in Cork, Ireland: The case of Carrigtwohill"
excerpt: "This radio interview was hosted by the national broadcaster of the Republic of Ireland. The discussion centres around a regional debate surrounding the location of a proposed major retail outlet. Using findings from my PhD research, I make the case that current plans do not align with policymaking missions to develop more sustainably in the Cork metropolitan area. You can find this interview [here](https://www.rte.ie/radio/radio1/drivetime/programmes/2023/0104/1344917-drivetime-wednesday-4-january-2023/). The relevant segment begins at 1 hour and 13 minutes into the broadcast."
