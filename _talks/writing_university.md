This talk was hosted for undergraduate students who were about to undertake the first research project of their academic journies. The purpose of this talk was to introduce them to writing conventions, techniques, and illustrate expectations surrounding what is "expected" in the writings of a university student. The slides for this talk can be found [here](files/Writing and Research in University.pdf).
