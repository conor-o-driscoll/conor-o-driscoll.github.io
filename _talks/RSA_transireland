This workshop, hosted by the Regional Studies Association (Irish Section), covered the topic of pressing transportation issues in Ireland. At this workshop, I presented ongoing research about commuting flows in the Cork Metropolitan Area, while other notable speakers included Dr. Kevin Credit of Maynooth University and Prof. Hannah Daly of University College Cork. The slides for this talk can be found [here](/files/Land-Use Patterns and Commuting in Cork.pdf).
