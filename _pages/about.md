About Me
======
Hi there!

My name is Conor. I recieved my PhD (Economics) from University College Cork, Ireland, where I was based in the [Spatial and Regional Economic Research Centre (SRERC)](https://www.ucc.ie/en/srerc/) between 2020-2023.

I am now an [Assistant Professor](https://www.rug.nl/staff/c.odriscoll/?lang=en) in the University of Groningen's [Faculty of Spatial Sciences](https://www.rug.nl/frw/?lang=en). My main areas of interest include: Urban Economics, Regional Science, and Economic Geography, while I possess technical expertise in Applied Econometrics, Network Analysis, and Quantitative Geography using R, STATA, and GIS. If yu have questions or wish to collaborate, you can reach me at c [dot] odriscoll [at] rug [dot] nl

In my free time, I like to run, play chess, cook, and read. I am an avid Track and Field fan, but also enjoy watching football (soccer). I have had the honour of representing the Republic of Ireland 4 times, once in an individual capacity, in competitive track and field events, while also holding numerous accolades from my days playing football (soccer).
