This covers a series of courses I taught at University College Cork. The content relates to undergraduate macroeconomics, and was taught to students studying economics, finance, and commerce. Relevant materials will be made available soon.

Introductory Macroeconomics
======
These courses start with the study of the economy as a whole, focusing on aggregate measures such as national income, unemployment, inflation, and economic growth. Students learn to work with theories of supply and demand, fiscal and monetary policy, international trade, and exchange rates, while also covering national income accounting, the measurement of economic activity, and the circular flow of income.

The role of government in influencing economic outcomes is also explored here. Topics such as fiscal policy, monetary policy, and the role of central banks will be discussed, along with the challenges and trade-offs involved in implementing macroeconomic policies. This provides students with opportunities to apply theoretical concepts to analyze current economic events and policy debates, enhancing their critical thinking and analytical skills.
