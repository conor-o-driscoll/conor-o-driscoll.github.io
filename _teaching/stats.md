This covers a series of courses I taught at University College Cork. The content relates to undergraduate statistics and econometrics, and was taught to students studying economics, finance, and commerce. Relevant materials can be made available upon request.

Introductory Statistics
======
These courses start with introductions to descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and probability. Much of this learning focuses on how these subjects relate to business practices. Students are introduced to elementary calculus, the mathematics of finance, alongside exponential, logarithmic, and polynomial functions. Students use this knowledge to calculate elasticities, solve for equilibrium, and work with series and annuities.

From there, a major emphasis is placed on the practical application of statistics to business contexts. Teaching centres around the practicalities of working with data. Students are exposed to key softwares used for analysing economic and financial data, such as excel and STATA. They are also tasked with collecting, analysing, interpreting, and presenting economic data in written reports. Supplementing this, are introductions to the numerous types of economic and financial data available, and the outlets from which these data can be acquired.
