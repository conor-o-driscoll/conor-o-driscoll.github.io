Welcome to my website! My name is Conor O'Driscoll and I am an Assistant Professor in Economic Geography within the University of Groningen's Faculty of Spatial Sciences.

This website will serve as a repository for research-related items, teaching materials, and other academic things people may find interesting. Any material borrowed from this website should be referenced appropriately. Below, I provide an outline of what you can expect from, and find on, this website

Research Materials and Activities
======
This website will be used as a repository for my past research activities as well as a platform to advertise and launch ongoing and future endeavours. In this regard, all published articles and other written works will be made available on this platform. Related code and data files used to generate key statistical outputs will also be made available. Similarly, any public engagement associated with my research activities will be posted here. Working papers and slides from talks and conferences will also be uploaded to this website, and I welcome feedback on this work. 

Should you have any questions or recommendations, I encourage you to get in touch. Likewise, if you would like to collaborate on an idea, please reach out to c [dot] odriscoll [at] rug [dot] nl

Teaching Materials
======
This website will host select materials from my university teaching. This will primarily involve guides to utilising statistical softwares, like R and STATA when conducting statistical analysis. But there will also be select slideshows, and recommended readings and literature lists. Some of this literature may be reviewed in my Blog Posts, or key concepts related to my teaching activities may be reviewed there.

Miscellaneous
------
Other elements of this site contain a copy of my cv. The footer indicates when this cv was last updated. In addition to this, my public engagement portfolio documents my endeavours to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and society at large. This section contains written works and interviews. 

Happy reading and looking forward to seeing how this project evolves and grows!
Conor
